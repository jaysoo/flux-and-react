# Introduction to Flux

---

# What is Flux?

- Architectural pattern for client applications

- **Unidirectional** data flow where reads are separated from writes (**CQRS**)

.center[

]

---

# Stores

- Read-only data; Transient state

- Does not store domain models but provides a view of them

- Cannot be affected by **Views**

- Updates own state based on Actions


```js
  class JobProductionStore {
    constructor(Dispatcher) {
      this._productions = {};
      Dispatcher.register('FINISHED_GOOD_PRODUCED', this.addProduction);
    }
    addProduction(payload) {
      const { jobId, palletNumber, ... } = payload;
      this._productions[jobId].push({
        // ...
      });
    }
    getProductions(jobId) {
      return this._productions[jobId]; // This can be used by Views.
    }
  }
```

---

# Actions

- Think of them as **Domain Events**

- Describe things that have happened in our domain

  e.g. `FINISHED_GOOD_PRODUCED`, `TRAILER_SHIPPED`, `INVENTORY_CONSUMED`

- Contains a payload that carry information about what happened

  ```js
    {
      action_id: 'FINISHED_GOOD_PRODUCED',

      payload: {
        jobId: 777,
        producedAt: '2015-01-01 13:00.000Z',
        palletNumber: '999',
        quantity: {
          value: 50,
          uom: 'cases'
        }
      }
    }
  ```

---

# Dispatcher

- One **Dispatcher** for the application

- All **Actions** are dispatched by the **Dispatcher**

- Registered **Stores** can update their state from **Actions**

- New Stores (e.g. `JobMetricsStore`) can be added that also responds to `FINISHED_GOOD_PRODUCED`.

- We only need to write new projections to map **Actions** to **Store** states.

# Flux vs MVC

---

class: center middle img-full-width

# MVC Refresher

.center[
  ![](./images/mvc-architecture.svg)
]

---

# Main differences

- **Model** in MVC is both read by **Views** and written to by **Controllers**

  - This can cause chaining of update events

- In MVC, there are no good way to deal with data that does not map 1-to-1 to
  **Models**

  - There are ways to address this (ViewModels, Presenters, etc.)

- **Models** fall outside of Flux, and **Views** read only from **Stores**

- **Stores** only need to handle **Actions**, and are not necessarily coupled to
  domain models

---

# Pros and Cons

## Pros

- Simpler data flow

- Reads and writes can change at different rates

- Mutations are more controlled, easier to write tests for

## Cons

- More boilerplate

  - This is mitigated by different Flux implementations

---

# Introduction to React

---

# React Component

- React components are the **Views** in Flux (or MVC).

- The most basic React component is one with a `render()` method.

```jsx
const ProductionsTable = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <table>
        {
          this.props.productions.map(p => (
            <tr>
              <td>{p.producedAt}</td>
              <td>{p.palletNumber}</td>
              <td>{p.lotCode}</td>
              <td>{p.expiryDate}</td>
              <td>{formatQuantity(p.quantity)}</td>
            </tr>
          ));
        }
      </table>
    );
  }
});
```

---

# JSX

- React (optionally) uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX.

- JSX gets compiled to ES5, which is what runs in the browser.

- It is pure JavaScript, so no need for helpers (Handlebars) or filters (Angular).

    ```jsx
      <div>
        <h1>{I18n.s_('Productions')}</h1>
        <ProductionsTable production={this.state.productions} />
      </div>
    ```


---

# State vs Props

- Components can have `states` and `props`.

- States can mutate within the component.

- Properties are passed down to the component, and cannot be mutated.

- Differentiate between a **Owner** component (stateful) and **UI/Ownee** component (stateless).

---

```jsx
  // Stateful component
  const Parent = React.createClass({
    constructor(store) {
      store.on('change', this.update);
    },

    update(messages) {
      // This triggers render()
      this.setState({ messages: messages });
    },

    render() {
      return (
        {this.state.messages.map(msg => (
          <Child message={msg}>
        )}
      );
    }
  });

  // Stateless component
  const Child = React.createClass({
    render() {
      return (
        <p>{this.props.message}</p>
      );
    }
  });
```

---

# Proptypes

Proptypes describe the API of a component. This is useful for documentation purposes
and to reduce errors.

```jsx
const {array, func} = React.PropTypes;

const Component = React.createClass({
  propTypes: {
    productions: array.isRequired,
    onProductionDeleted: func,
    onProductionUpdated: func
  },

  render() {
  }
});

// usage
const handleDeletedProduction = () => // ...

<Component production={[...]} onProductionDeleted={handleDeletedProduction()}>
```

---

# The Virtual DOM

- An in-memory representation of the DOM (POJOs).

- React components do not render directly into the DOM.

- Components do full renders to virtual DOM.

- React diffs the virtual DOM with the real DOM, and computes minimal mutations
  to update the latter.

- *This is how game engines work* :)

- No **two-way data binding** in React

- React Components are much **simpler**

  - No digest cycles, scopes, transclusion

- No string templates, just pure JavaScript

  - This makes **debugging easier**

# Pros and Cons

## Pros

- Renders are simpler and close to server renders

- React is moving towards ECMAScript standards, whereas Angular 2 requires TypeScript

- Proptypes improve documentation and reduces errors

## Cons

- No two-way data binding

- Have to learn JSX

- Editor support for JSX may be poor
